# Scenario: Undoing the Last Commit

Imagine you are working on a project and you have made a commit that you realize needs some changes. You want to undo the last commit but keep your changes staged so you can quickly amend the commit after making the necessary adjustments.

#### Initial Setup:

- You have a file `data.txt` with the following content:
  ```text
  Line 1
  Line 2
  ```

- You accidentally added a new line and committed the changes:
  ```text
  Line 1
  Line 2
  Line 3 (wrong content)
  ```

- The commit history looks like this:
  ```sh
  commit abc1234: Add incorrect line to data.txt
  commit def5678: Initial commit
  ```

### Your Challenge:

1. **Use `git reset --soft` to undo the last commit**.
2. **Make the necessary changes to `data.txt`**.
3. **Recommit the changes correctly**.

### Detailed Steps:

#### Step 1: Use `git reset --soft` to Undo the Last Commit

1. **View the current commit history**:
   ```sh
   git log --oneline
   ```
   This shows:
   ```sh
   abc1234 Add incorrect line to data.txt
   def5678 Initial commit
   ```

2. **Reset the last commit while keeping changes staged**:
   ```sh
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   ```

   After this command, your commit history will no longer include the last commit, but the changes made in that commit will remain staged.

#### Step 2: Make the Necessary Changes to `data.txt`

1. **Edit `data.txt` to correct the content**:
   ```text
   Line 1
   Line 2
   Line 3 (corrected content)
   ```

2. **Stage the changes if needed**:
   Since `git reset --soft` keeps the changes staged, this step may not be necessary. However, if you made additional edits and need to restage:
   ```sh
   git add data.txt
   ```

#### Step 3: Recommit the Changes Correctly

1. **Commit the corrected changes**:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add corrected line to data.txt"
   ```

2. **Verify the commit history**:
   ```sh
   git log --oneline
   ```
   This should show:
   ```sh
   new_commit_hash Add corrected line to data.txt
   def5678 Initial commit
   ```

### Solution Verification:

To verify that the challenge was solved correctly, the following criteria should be met:
- The last commit has been undone and the changes were kept staged.
- `data.txt` contains the corrected content.
- The commit history reflects the corrected commit message and content.

### Detailed Explanation:

#### Before `git reset --soft`:
- `data.txt` content:
  ```text
  Line 1
  Line 2
  Line 3 (wrong content)
  ```

- Commit history:
  ```sh
  abc1234 Add incorrect line to data.txt
  def5678 Initial commit
  ```

#### After `git reset --soft`:
- `data.txt` content remains the same but changes are staged:
  ```text
  Line 1
  Line 2
  Line 3 (wrong content)
  ```

- Commit history:
  ```sh
  def5678 Initial commit
  ```

#### After making corrections and recommitting:
- `data.txt` content:
  ```text
  Line 1
  Line 2
  Line 3 (corrected content)
  ```

- Commit history:
  ```sh
  new_commit_hash Add corrected line to data.txt
  def5678 Initial commit
  ```

### Conclusion:

This scenario demonstrates how to use `git reset --soft` to undo the last commit while keeping your changes staged. This is particularly useful when you realize immediately after committing that some adjustments are necessary. By using `git reset --soft`, you can quickly make the needed changes and recommit without losing any work.
